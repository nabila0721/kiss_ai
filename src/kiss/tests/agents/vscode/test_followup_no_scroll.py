"""Regression test: ``Suggested next`` MUST NOT scroll the chat to the bottom.

The bug (reported by the user): rendering a ``followup_suggestion`` event in
the live webview message handler appended the ``Suggested next`` bar to the
output area AND then called ``sb()`` (the scroll-to-bottom helper).  This
forced the chat view to jump to the end every time a follow-up was streamed,
even if the user had scrolled up to read earlier content.

Symmetrically, the *replay* path (``replayEventsInto`` in ``main.js``) renders
the same bar and does NOT scroll — so the live handler was the outlier.

This test enforces, at the JavaScript-source level, that the live
``case 'followup_suggestion':`` arm of ``handleEvent`` does NOT invoke ``sb()``.
A pure static-source check (no DOM shim, no Node) is sufficient because the
fix is the removal of a single ``sb();`` call inside that case body.
